This is the website for my satirical school newspaper: The Gadfly.  
Simple static website with vanilla JavaScript; mostly coded by myself, with AI assistance in places (Kagi Code/Claude 4.5 Sonnet & Gemini Flash Lite). Of course, the content itself is certified No-AI; that means the issue & website contents are 100% human written & created, no matter how bad.
