                <h2>About The Gadfly</h2>
                <p>The Gadfly is an independent satirical newspaper. Student-first and student-run, whilst The Gadfly technically exists as a club at <a href="https://lhs.wrdsb.ca/files/2025/10/Meet-Storm-V2-750x938.png" style="color: #2d5016">LHSS</a>, we still operate mostly by ourselves (with oversight and occasional edits when required). We attempt to deliver amusing content, interesting ideas, and high-quality writing.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Beginning  -  [May 2025]</h3>
                    <p>The story of The Gadfly begins with <a href="pages/outcast.html" class="subtle-link">The Backcast</a>, a satirical newspaper with largely the same spirit as The Gadfly, but unrefined (and unsanctioned). Our first issue was released in May 2025.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Fall  -  [June 2025]</h3>
                    <p>The Backcast continued the next month. In June 2025, issue #2 of The Backcast was published. Due to a combination of effects, The Backcast was formally shut down.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Rebirth  -  [Summer Break 2025]</h3>
                    <p>After a small party to celebrate the life &amp; times of The Backcast, we decided to continue the paper officially. We originally planned on calling our paper 'The Outcast', but out of concern that the name might sound too similar to Backcast or Forecast, we decided to pivot entirely. And, like that, The Gadfly was born. We spent the summer crafting our founding docs and writing our first issue.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Early Gadfly  -  [September 2025]</h3>
                    <p>With our heads held high, our newspaper and founding docs in hand, we met with our principal as soon as possible. He graciously allowed us to continue, even with our stipulations of not being a club in the traditional manner (not allowing people in freely, no club fair, etc.); we thank him greatly for this. We found a teacher sponsor who meshed well with The Gadfly and, after minor revisions and edits, we published our first issue under The Gadfly name.</p>

                    <h3>Why does it look like 'The Badfly'?</h3>
                    <p>You're probably just bad at reading.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is your relation to The Forecast?</h3>
                    <p>We aren't competitors, nor are we collaborators; we're complementary papers with different goals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why the name 'The Gadfly'?</h3>
                    <p>The name Gadfly was chosen because we wanted to call ourselves something more pompous than 'Outcast'. We landed on the term that Socrates used when on trial for his life, having been accused of corrupting the youth.</p>
