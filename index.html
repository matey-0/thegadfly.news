                <h2>About The Gadfly</h2>
                <p>
The Gadfly is the worst (and only) satire newspaper at <a href="https://lhs.wrdsb.ca/files/2025/10/Meet-Storm-V2-750x938.png" style="color: #2d5016">LHSS</a>. Before you stop reading, just know that we also hate the idea. The reason we're special is because we publish lies (see: satire). If you're a grefegenkalent admin, just know that we're super official; we have a constitution that in no way satirises you!</p>

                    <h3>The Beginning  -  [May 2025]</h3>
                    <p>In the beginning, there was nothing. A few billion years later, <a href="pages/thebackcast.html" class="subtle-link">The Backcast</a> was created. A satirical paper similar to The Gadfly, (but worse in every way). it's almost laughable looking back. Ha ha.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Fall  -  [June 2025]</h3>
                    <p>The Backcast published its second issue. Due to reasons we cannot openly discuss, The Backcast was shut down and all copies ordered to be burned. We allegedly complied with this demand.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>The Rebirth  -  [Summer Break 2025]</h3>
                    <p>We were defeated. After a small party to celebrate the life & times of The Backcast, a wise man urged Hassan out of his cowardice; we unanimously decided to continue officially. Our revival was originally called 'The Outcast', but that sounded emo, lame, and honestly really boring. We decided on 'The Gadfly', though other names (Hamelin, Reynard, Errata, Persona Non Grata) were also floated around.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>Early Gadfly  -  [September 2025]</h3>
                    <p>With our heads held high, newspaper and paperwork in hand, we met with the principal as soon as possible. He let us continue, probably so that we wouldn't keep bugging him; now we have a functional, non-stalker relationship. Going forwards, we're official and follow all the rules. We soon published our first issue under The Gadfly name.</p>

                    <h3>Why does it look like 'The Badfly'?</h3>
                    <p>You're probably just bad at reading.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why the name 'The Gadfly'?</h3>
                    <p>The name Gadfly was chosen because we wanted to call ourselves something more pompous than 'Outcast'. We landed on the term that Socrates used when on trial for his life, having been accused of corrupting the youth.</p>
